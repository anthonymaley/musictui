## Requirements

  ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  macOS           Required (AppleScript is macOS    │
  │                  only)                             │
  │                                                    │

```

## How it works

The plugin teaches Claude how to control Apple Music through AppleScript (`osascript`). When you mention anything music-related, Claude builds and runs the right AppleScript commands behind the scenes. You never have to write any scripts yourself — just describe what you want in plain English.

```
  You: "play Kid A on the kitchen speaker"
   │
   ├─ osascript: route audio to Kitchen
   ├─ osascript: search library for "Kid A"
   └─ osascript: play first result
   │
  Claude: "Playing Kid A — Everything In Its Right Place."
```

## Limitations

- Searches your **local Apple Music library** only — catalog browsing requires the Music app
- Queue management ("add to Up Next") is limited by AppleScript
- Listing all albums can be slow on very large libraries
- AirPods must be connected via Bluetooth to appear as a device
