## Four Ways to Use It

| Layer | How | Setup | Token cost |
|-------|-----|-------|-----------|
| **Media keys** (⏯ ⏭ ⏮) | Transport: play/pause, next, previous — your keyboard already does this | None | None |
| **Natural language** (`/music play Kid A in the kitchen and living room at 60%`) | Everything in words: playback with routing, search, playlists, discovery | Build CLI from source | Normal |
| **CLI + TUI** (`music`, `music now`, `music speaker`) | Terminal commands, interactive shell, scriptable | Build from source | None |
| **CLI + API** (`music search`, `music playlist create`) | Catalog, library, discovery | + Apple Developer account | None |

There are no per-action slash commands — `/music` (the skill) is the single entry point, and bare transport belongs to the keys your Mac already has.

## Install

### Claude Code (CLI)

```bash
# Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add anthonymaley/apple-music

# Install the plugin
/plugin install music@apple-music-marketplace
```

### Claude Desktop App (Cowork)

1. Click **+** next to the prompt box
2. Select **Plugins**
3. Choose **Add plugin**
4. Browse and select **Apple Music**

### Build the CLI (one command, no account needed)

The plugin drives the `music` CLI, so build it once after installing (Swift 5.9+, ships with Xcode):

```bash
# The trailing version segment changes on each plugin update
cd ~/.claude/plugins/cache/apple-music-marketplace/music/*/
scripts/install.sh
```

That unlocks playback, multi-room AirPlay routing, volume, the TUI, and the status line — no Apple Developer account required.

### Update

```bash
# CLI
claude plugin update music@apple-music-marketplace

# Desktop — Manage plugins → Update
```

After updating the plugin, rebuild the CLI: `scripts/install.sh`

### Uninstall

```bash
# Remove the plugin
claude plugin uninstall music@apple-music-marketplace

# Remove the CLI binary and all config (auth keys + tokens)
rm -f ~/.local/bin/music
rm -rf ~/.config/music
```

Desktop: **Manage plugins** → remove **Apple Music**. The venue EQ presets the plugin created in Music (Nightclub, Dungeon, …) live in Music's own Equalizer — delete them there if you want them gone.

### Advanced Features (optional, requires Apple Developer account)

For catalog search, library management, playlists via API, and music discovery, you also need:

1. An **Apple Developer account** ($99/year at [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com))
2. A **MusicKit key** configured via guided setup

```bash
# Guided auth setup — walks you through creating a MusicKit key
music auth setup

# Get your user token (opens browser, auto-saves)
music auth

# Verify
music auth status
```

## Playback, Speakers & Volume (CLI — zero auth)

> **Transport tip:** play/pause, next, and previous are on your keyboard (⏯ ⏭ ⏮ media keys) — they control Apple Music natively, from any app, with nothing installed. The commands below are for everything the keys can't say: *what* to play, *where*, and *how loud*.

### Playback

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `music play` | Resume playback |
| `music play Working Vibes` | Play a playlist |
| `music play kid a in the kitchen and living room at 60` | Multi-room: route to several speakers at a volume, filler words welcome |
| `music play Working Vibes kitchen 60 shuffle` | Speaker + volume + shuffle in one shot |
| `music play 3` | Play result #3 from last search/playlist |
| `music play "Gypsy Woman" "Tom Misch"` | Play a song by title + artist; falls back to catalog add if authenticated |
| `music play "https://music.apple.com/...?...i=1581424482"` | Add/play a catalog song URL when authenticated |
| `music play --album "Kid A" --artist "Radiohead"` | Explicit flags when the name could collide with a speaker |
| `music pause` / `music skip` / `music back` / `music stop` | Transport from the terminal |
| `music now` | What's playing (track, album, speakers) |
| `music shuffle` / `music repeat off\|one\|all` | Shuffle and repeat modes |
| `music seek +30` / `music seek 1:30` | Seek within the current track (relative or absolute) |
| `music love` / `music unlove` | Favorite / unfavorite the current track |

Naming speakers in `music play` routes playback to **exactly those speakers** — it selects the ones you name and deselects the rest, then verifies each route is actually carrying a session (network-truth, not the AppleScript `selected` claim, which can lie) and prints `✓ <speaker> verified (…)`. If a route doesn't establish, an automatic heal runs — an away-and-back reroute, then a transport-cycle reset — before an honest failure message names the manual fix. Routing to the Mac's own output is never "verified" — local output has no AirPlay session to check.

### Speakers & Volume

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `music speaker` | Interactive picker with ←→ volume control |
| `music speaker kitchen` | Add kitchen to active speakers |
| `music speaker kitchen 40` | Add kitchen at volume 40 |
| `music speaker kitchen stop` | Remove kitchen from group |
| `music speaker airpods only` | Switch to AirPods only |
| `music speaker wake [kitchen]` | Verify active speakers first, then reset only the ones that didn't establish |
| `music speaker verify [kitchen]` | Network-truth verdict: is the route actually carrying a session? No name = verify all selected speakers (`--json` supported) |
| `music speaker 1 2 5` | Add speakers by number from last list |
| `music volume` | Interactive per-speaker volume mixer |
| `music volume 60` | Set all active speakers to 60 |
| `music volume up` / `down` | Volume ±10 |
| `music volume kitchen 80` | Set a specific speaker to 80 |

Adding a speaker, `music speaker set`, or `music speaker only` verify the route automatically while playing and heal it if needed; while paused they print `Route set; will verify on next play.` — paused routes can't be verified over the network, so the next play re-checks them.

### Equalizer

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `music eq` | Show active preset + EQ status |
| `music eq nightclub` | Select a venue preset (fuzzy; created as a real Music.app preset on first use) |
| `music eq "Bass Booster"` | Select any Music built-in preset by name |
| `music eq list` | List all available presets (venue pack first, then Music's built-ins) |
| `music eq on` / `music eq off` | Enable or disable EQ |
| `music eq remove-pack` | Delete the venue preset pack |

Venue pack (Nightclub, Dungeon, Open Air, Concert Hall, Jazz Club, Stadium, Cathedral, Late Night) — each is a real Music.app preset created on first selection and visible in Music's own EQ window. Selecting any preset auto-enables EQ. Unknown names print near-matches.

> **Equalizer requires Accessibility permission.** Music's scripting interface for live EQ state is broken in current macOS builds, so `music eq` drives the real Equalizer window instead (which it opens and leaves open). Grant your terminal app access under System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility — the command tells you if it's missing. Preset creation and deletion need no extra permission.

### Visualizer

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `music visualizer` | Show visualizer on/off status |
| `music visualizer on` / `off` | Toggle Music's on-screen visualizer (the Cmd-T visuals) |

Toggles Music's built-in visualizer — the animated graphics that render **in the Music app window on your Mac's display** (not on AirPlay outputs). Turning it on brings Music to the front. Same Accessibility permission as the equalizer; in the TUI, the Speakers scene has a Visualizer row (`Enter` or `v` toggles).

## CLI Commands

```
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  Requires Apple Developer account ($99/yr) + build from     │
  │  source. See "Advanced Features" above for setup.           │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Search

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `music search "gypsy woman"` | Catalog search — songs by default, numbered so `music play 3` works |
| `music search "kid a" --types songs,albums,artists,playlists` | Multi-type catalog search (any subset) |
| `music search "radiohead" --library` | Search your library instead of the catalog |
| `music search "gypsy woman" --artist "crystal waters"` | Refine by `--artist` / `--album` |
| `music search "fouk" --limit 20 --json` | More results, structured output |

### Playlist Management

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `music playlist create "Friday Mix"` | Create an empty playlist |
| `music playlist create "Friday Mix" 1 3 5` | Create from search result indices |
| `music playlist add "House" 1 3 5` | Add search results to existing playlist |
| `music playlist delete "Old Playlist"` | Delete a playlist |
| `music playlist remove "House" "Song"` | Remove a track from a playlist |
| `music playlist share "Mix" --imessage "+1234567890"` | Share via iMessage |
| `music playlist share "Mix" --email "a@b.com"` | Share via email |
| `music playlist create-from "Song" "Artist" ... --name "Mix"` | Create + populate from title/artist pairs |
| `music playlist temp "Song" "Artist" ...` | Temp playlist, auto-cleanup |

### Library

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `music add --to "House"` | Add current song to a playlist |
| `music add 3 --to "House"` | Add result #3 to a playlist |
| `music remove` | Remove current song from current playlist |
| `music remove "House"` | Remove current song from "House" |
| `music remove all` | Remove current song from all playlists |

### Discovery

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `music similar` | Similar to what's playing |
| `music suggest 10 --from "Working Vibes"` | Suggest tracks from playlist vibe |
| `music new-releases --like-current` | New releases from current artist |
| `music mix --artists "Fouk,Floating Points" --name "Friday Mix"` | Mixed playlist |
| `music recent` | Recently played tracks (numbered, so `music play 3` works) |
| `music rotation` | Your heavy-rotation music |

### Diagnostics

Add `--verbose` (`-v`) to any command for diagnostic output on stderr:

```bash
music speaker smart --verbose wake kitchen   # see deselect/reselect/verify steps
music play --playlist "Working Vibes" -v     # see AppleScript calls
music speaker smart --verbose list --json    # verbose on stderr, JSON on stdout
```

Failures surface on **stderr** by default — a failed AirPlay route, a now-playing read error, or a malformed config prints a `✗`/`⚠` line, and `--json` mode emits an error object rather than corrupting the stream — so stdout stays clean for piping.

### JSON Output

Every command supports `--json` for scripting and automation:

```bash
music now --json          # structured now-playing
music search "Fouk" --json --limit 20   # structured search results
music playlist list --json               # structured playlist list
```

```

  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Natural Language (Skill)

For anything multi-step, just talk. Claude composes the right sequence of CLI calls automatically.

```
> Look at the Working Vibes playlist. See the last ten tracks on that
  playlist. Make a separate playlist with those ten tracks and shuffle
  them. Play it on the kitchen and Sonos Arc at 60%.

> Take the current track and search for new records that match this
  style. Put them in a playlist and shuffle them.

> It's great. Share it with Julie on iMessage.

> Play Kid A by Radiohead in the kitchen and living room at 60%.

> Switch to my AirPods and turn it down to 30.

> Add the bedroom to the group and turn the kitchen down to 40.

> What's new from Radiohead? Make a playlist of the best ones.
```

Claude handles multi-step orchestration — searching the catalog, creating playlists, routing to speakers, setting volume, sharing — all from one sentence.

## Apple Music TUI

Run bare `music` in a real terminal (not inside Claude Code — TUI requires a TTY). Install `chafa` (`brew install chafa`) for album art in now-playing.

**Unified shell** (`music`) — a tabbed interface with **Now**, **Playlists**, **Speakers**, and **Library** tabs. The Now tab shows a 3-column layout: album art, playback metadata, and a right pane. Select a playlist on the Playlists tab to pin it on the Now tab so you can browse and replay any track while playback continues.

> **Turn off Music's Autoplay (∞).** Playlist track-selection and up/down navigation drive playback track-by-track and rely on a track *stopping* at its end. With Autoplay on, Music bleeds into the library between tracks. Disable it once in Music's Up Next panel (the ∞ button).

**Global keys** (work on every tab):

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `1`/`2`/`3`/`4` | Jump to Now / Playlists / Speakers / Library tab |
| `Tab` / `Shift-Tab` | Cycle tabs forward / backward |
| `Space` | Play/pause |
| `<` / `>` | Previous / next track (full up/down through the playlist) |
| `z` | Shuffle-play the current context |
| `+`/`-` | Master volume ±5 |
| `q` | Quit |

**Now tab:**

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑`/`↓` | Navigate the track pane (or control rows, when the grid is focused) |
| `PgUp`/`PgDn`/`Home`/`End` | Page and jump in long lists |
| `Enter` | Play selected track (or cycle the focused control's value) |
| `←` / `→` | Focus the control grid / return to the Up Next list |
| `[` / `]` | Seek ±30s |
| `s` / `m` | Shuffle on/off / cycle order (Songs → Albums → Groupings) |
| `r` / `g` | Cycle repeat (Off → All → One) / Genius Shuffle |
| `l` | Favorite the current track |
| `n` | Next-up options (shuffle / playlist / quiet) |
| `Esc` | Back / dismiss menu |

Under the track progress is a **control grid** (Shuffle / Order / Repeat / Genius) showing each value live with the active one lit — press `←` to focus it, `↑↓` to move rows, `Enter` to cycle. Two markers in the track pane: green `▶` = currently playing, inverse video = cursor position. Genius Shuffle's queue isn't readable via Apple's scripting, so while it's active the Up Next reads "Genius Shuffle Active" rather than a (wrong) track list.

![Now Playing](media/nowplaying.png)

**Playlists tab** — left: playlists (instant highlight on `↑↓`, no fetch; `/` filters as you type, arrows still navigate). Right: tracks (loaded on `Enter`, which also pins the playlist on the Now tab). `p` plays playlist, `s` shuffles, `b`/`Esc` goes back. Apple-curated playlists you've added to your library (Replay, Essentials, etc.) appear with an `APPLE` badge — no need to duplicate them, so they keep receiving Apple's weekly/monthly updates. The focused playlist shows its real cover art when signed in (built-in smart playlists keep a generated placeholder).

![Playlist Browser](media/playlist.jpg)

**Speakers tab** — `↑↓` select, `Enter` toggles AirPlay outputs on/off, `←→` adjusts per-speaker volume. Active speakers show volume bars. Toggling a speaker on while playing verifies the route and toasts (e.g. `'X' selected but route NOT verified — try: music speaker wake`) if it couldn't be verified. Below the outputs: an **EQ block** (power row + preset picker — `Enter` toggles/expands, `e` toggles from anywhere) and a **Visualizer** row (`Enter` or `v` toggles Music's on-screen visuals). (The `music speaker`, `music eq`, and `music visualizer` CLIs drive these non-interactively.)

![Speaker Picker](media/speakers.png)

**Library tab** (needs the Apple Music user token) — browse your library in three sub-views, **Artists · Albums · Songs** (opens on Artists), switched with `[`/`]`. `Enter` opens an album's tracks or drills Artist → their albums → tracks; `p` plays and `s` shuffles the focused item (albums/artists play as an app-owned queue — a scoped, navigable Up Next that stops at the album's end; needs Autoplay ∞ off). `/` filters as you type. On the Artists list, `a` cycles a track-count filter — **All → 12″/EP → Albums** — which cuts the bloat Apple's library-artists list carries (every artist with any library track, even one dragged in by a single playlist song) and separates 12″s/EPs from full-album deep cuts; drilling into an artist shows only that tier's albums. The first activation each session paints instantly from a cache, revalidated in the background. The focused album shows its real cover art, rendered in the terminal — fetched once, cached on disk.

```

After running `scripts/install.sh`, add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "~/.local/bin/music-statusline"
  }
}
```

> `install.sh` copies the status line script to `~/.local/bin/music-statusline` — a stable path that survives `claude plugin update` (the plugin cache directory is versioned and changes on every update, so don't point at it directly). Configure this once.

## What Needs Auth?

| Feature | No auth | Developer token | + User token |
|---------|---------|----------------|-------------|
| Play, pause, skip, stop, seek, shuffle, repeat | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Speakers, volume, now playing, love/unlove | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Catalog search | — | Yes | Yes |
| Library search (`--library`) + Library tab | — | — | Yes |
| Add to library | — | — | Yes |
| Playlist CRUD via API | — | — | Yes |
| Similar, suggestions, new releases, mix | — | — | Yes |
| Recently played, heavy rotation | — | — | Yes |

## How It Works

Everything routes through the `music` CLI. The `/music` skill turns natural language into CLI calls; the TUI and terminal use the CLI directly; transport keys talk to Music.app natively.

```
  Media keys ─────────────────────► Music.app (play/pause, next, previous)
  /music skill ──► music CLI ──► AppleScript (playback, speakers, volume)
  TUI / terminal ─┘          └──► REST API (catalog, library, playlists, discovery)
```

Search results are cached locally (`~/.config/music/last-songs.json`). When you run `music search`, `music similar`, or view playlist tracks, the numbered results persist so you can reference them by index in follow-up commands like `music play 3` or `music add 3 --to "House"`. Play commands show full now-playing info (track, album, speakers) after starting playback.

Speaker lists work the same way (`~/.config/music/last-speakers.json`). Run `music speaker list`, then `music speaker 1 2 5` to add speakers by their numbers.

## Requirements

- **macOS** (AppleScript is macOS only)
- **Apple Music** (comes with macOS)
- **Automation permission** (System Settings > Privacy & Security > Automation > enable for your terminal)
- **Swift 5.9+** (only if building the music CLI)
- **AirPods** must be connected via Bluetooth to appear as a device
- **chafa** (optional, `brew install chafa` — enables album art in now-playing TUI)
