// Music.app equalizer access — two transports, by necessity:
//
//  * EQ PRESET objects (create / read bands / delete) script fine through
//    the normal Music dictionary and go through runMusic.
//  * LIVE state (EQ enabled, current preset) is severed in current
//    Music.app builds: writes error (-10006 / -1731 in every reference
//    form) and reads return stale values even while the real Equalizer
//    is on — verified live 2026-06-12. The Equalizer window's own
//    controls are the only working interface, so live state goes through
//    System Events UI scripting. That requires Accessibility permission
//    for the host terminal, and opens the Equalizer window (leaving it
//    open) on first use.
//
// Free-function style mirrors fetchSpeakerDevices() in SpeakerCommands.swift.
