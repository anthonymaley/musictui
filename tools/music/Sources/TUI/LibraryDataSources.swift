/// false to abort mid-walk (the scene deallocated). The REST endpoints cap a
/// single response at `pageSize` (100), so we advance `offset` until a short page
/// signals exhaustion, or `cap` trips as a safety valve against an endpoint that
/// never returns a short page. A mid-walk failure (page returns []) reads as a
