// Favorite stations, persisted locally at ~/.config/music/stations.json —
// deliberately NOT Apple's library. A station added to the library becomes a
// URL track whose *name is its id* ("ra.978194965"), which would litter the
// Songs list. Local storage also keeps stations the catalog API cannot resolve
// (BBC Radio 1) as first-class favorites: each entry carries its own url+name,
// so the tab paints and plays from disk with no network at all.
